# Invariants

Cross-cutting "if you change X, also touch Y" rules. Each entry: rule,
one-line *why*, source.

### 1. Root `Cargo.toml` is a workspace shim, sole member `graywolf-modem`

*Why:* Lets cross-rs's Docker mount see `proto/` and `VERSION` from the repo root; cargo output therefore lands at `/target/`, which Makefile, modem-path fallbacks, modembridge integration tests, and release CI all hard-code.

Source: [`../../Cargo.toml`](../../Cargo.toml) (comment is authoritative),
[`../../Makefile`](../../Makefile),
[`../../pkg/app/modem.go`](../../pkg/app/modem.go).

### 2. `proto/graywolf.proto` is the single Go<->Rust IPC contract

*Why:* Both sides regenerate from this file (wire format `[4 BE bytes length][IpcMessage]`), so any change requires regenerating both.

Source: [`../../proto/graywolf.proto`](../../proto/graywolf.proto). Go:
`make proto` -> `pkg/ipcproto/graywolf.pb.go`. Rust:
[`../../graywolf-modem/build.rs`](../../graywolf-modem/build.rs) ->
`OUT_DIR/graywolf.rs`.

### 3. Version locks

*Why:* `make bump-*` rewrites every version-bearing file in lockstep, so hand edits drift and downstream packaging breaks.

Source: bump targets in [`../../Makefile`](../../Makefile)
(`VERSION`, `graywolf-modem/Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`,
`packaging/aur/PKGBUILD`, `packaging/aur/.SRCINFO`,
`docs/handbook/installation.html`).

### 4. Release notes precede the bump

*Why:* The bump targets `grep` `pkg/releasenotes/notes.yaml` for the *new* version and refuse to run if the entry is missing.

Source: [`../../Makefile`](../../Makefile),
[`../../pkg/releasenotes/notes.yaml`](../../pkg/releasenotes/notes.yaml),
[`../../CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md).

### 5. Release notes ship as-tagged (retag contract)

*Why:* When CI fails after tag-push and you delete-and-re-tag the same version, leave the note alone -- operators see whatever shipped at the final successful tag, and silent reword between retags is a trust hazard.

Source: [`../../CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md) ("Retag contract").

### 6. Plain ASCII in release notes

*Why:* No emoji, em dashes, smart quotes, or non-ASCII punctuation -- keeps the operator-facing changelog portable since bump targets do not re-encode the YAML.

Source: [`../../CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md);
[`../../pkg/releasenotes/notes.yaml`](../../pkg/releasenotes/notes.yaml)
header.

### 7. PMTiles / offline-maps infra lives in `~/dev/graywolf-maps`, not here

*Why:* Tile generation, R2 sync, manifest publishing, and the origin Cloudflare Worker all live in the maps repo; graywolf is a *client* (`mapsauth`, `mapscache`, MapLibre rendering).

Source: absence of those modules in this tree;
`~/dev/graywolf-maps/.context/graywolf-client-integration.md`.

### 8. Audio I/O is on the Rust side

*Why:* CPAL runs in `graywolf-modem` and Go talks to the modem only via the IPC proto, keeping realtime DSP out of Go's GC and platform-specific audio in one place.

Source: [`../../graywolf-modem/src/audio/`](../../graywolf-modem/src/audio/);
no CPAL dep in `pkg/`; control surface is the proto messages
`ConfigureAudio` / `StartAudio` / `StopAudio` / `EnumerateAudioDevices`.

**8a. Capture-device enumeration never probes in-use hardware.**
On Linux, `EnumerateAudioDevices` (`collect_input_devices_linux`
in `modem/mod.rs`) collapses cpal's numeric/symbolic ALSA aliases to one
entry per physical card (via `/proc/asound/cards`) and *probes* each
**idle** card — briefly opening it — to badge "Recommended" the PCM form
that actually streams. A card currently held open by a live capture
stream is **never** probed (opening a second stream on in-use hardware
can disrupt the running radio) and is surfaced from the in-use snapshot
the handler passes in, so a rescan keeps showing it. The
string-only `is_recommended_pcm_id` heuristic is now used **only** by the
flare `--list-audio` path and the Linux *output* path; flare
`recommended` and the live capture picker intentionally diverge (the
separate `--list-audio` process can't probe safely). The live picker is
authoritative.

Output side: idle outputs enumerate unchanged (`collect_devices`), but a
configured/in-use output card (e.g. the AIOC's shared in/out PCM, whose
`supported_output_configs()` fails once RX holds the card) is re-appended
from the in-use-output snapshot, one entry per physical card, without
opening the device — so a configured output never vanishes from
detection while audio is running.

### 9. PTT enumeration vs. driving split

*Why:* Go enumerates PTT hardware and Rust drives it, so both sides must agree on the identifier scheme passed via `ConfigurePtt.method` and `ConfigurePtt.device`.

Source: [`../../pkg/pttdevice/`](../../pkg/pttdevice/);
[`../../graywolf-modem/src/tx/`](../../graywolf-modem/src/tx/);
[`../../proto/graywolf.proto`](../../proto/graywolf.proto)
(`ConfigurePtt`).

### 9a. PTT is one-row-per-channel; PUT supports atomic rekey

*Why:* `PttConfig.ChannelID` carries a uniqueIndex, so an operator changing the channel field on an existing PTT means *move*, not copy. `PUT /api/ptt/{channel}` matches the body's `channel_id` against the URL's: same → in-place upsert; different → atomic rekey in a single GORM transaction (`Store.RekeyPttConfig`), with `ErrPttChannelTaken` mapped to HTTP 400 on collision. The bridge reload (`notifyBridgeForChannel` → `ReconfigureAudioDevice`) is global, so a single notify covers both vacated and newly-targeted channels.

Source: [`../../pkg/configstore/store.go`](../../pkg/configstore/store.go) (`RekeyPttConfig`, `ErrPttChannelTaken`);
[`../../pkg/webapi/ptt.go`](../../pkg/webapi/ptt.go) (`updatePttConfig`).

### 9b. PTT writes are rejected on KISS-TNC channels

*Why:* A KISS TNC owns the radio interface end-to-end including PTT, so a graywolf-driven PTT row on top of a KISS-only channel (`Channel.InputDeviceID == nil`) is at best redundant and at worst keys the wrong radio after the operator reassigns channels (issue #110). The webapi handlers gate POST `/api/ptt` and both branches of PUT `/api/ptt/{channel}` (in-place upsert AND rekey) through `validatePttChannelBacking`, which returns HTTP 400. For rekey the validator runs against `req.ChannelID` (the move target), not the URL id, so an operator cannot bypass the rule by editing an existing PTT row onto a KISS channel. The PTT page mirrors the rule by hiding KISS-only channels from the channel dropdown.

Source: [`../../pkg/webapi/ptt.go`](../../pkg/webapi/ptt.go) (`validatePttChannelBacking`);
[`../../pkg/webapi/ptt_test.go`](../../pkg/webapi/ptt_test.go) (`TestPttRejectsKissOnlyChannel`);
[`../../web/src/routes/Ptt.svelte`](../../web/src/routes/Ptt.svelte) (`modemChannels` filter).

### 9c. Android PTT transport is a first-class `ptt_method`; `gpio_pin` is CM108-only

*Why:* The Android per-channel PTT transport (PttMethod enum, spec Appendix B: 1 = CP2102N RTS / Digirig, 2 = CM108 HID, 3 = AIOC CDC-ACM DTR, 4 = VOX, 5 = DIGIRIG_TONE) travels in its own field the whole way: SPA `POST /api/ptt {method:"android", ptt_method:N}` → `PttConfig.PttMethod` → `session.go` → `ConfigurePtt.ptt_method` (a `uint32`, deliberately not the `platform.proto` enum, to keep `graywolf.proto` self-contained — invariant #2) → Rust `build_driver` (`PttMethod::Android` does `let method = cfg.ptt_method as i32`) → `AndroidPtt` → JNI → Kotlin `UsbPttAdapter.pttSet`. `method=="android"` is only the coarse subsystem discriminator. **`gpio_pin` is the CM108 HID pin and nothing else** — it must never carry the Android transport (an earlier build did, via a `method=="android"` sentinel, which silently downgraded saved AIOC configs to CP2102N on re-save when a response DTO dropped the field; removed by migration v22 `ptt_android_method_field`).

*Tone PTT divergence (method 5):* Unlike transports 1–4, the Digirig Lite tone method has **no USB PTT line**. `AndroidPtt` does **not** call `UsbPttAdapter.pttSet` for it; instead `key`/`unkey` invoke the **`AudioTxCallback.setTone(active, hz)`** upcall (mark frequency read from `config_state` at key time), and the keying tone is synthesised in Kotlin's `AudioTxPump` on a **stereo** track (`L`=AFSK, `R`=tone — `ToneOscillator`, a port of the desktop `audio/soundcard.rs` `PttTone`). The Rust→Kotlin PCM contract stays **mono** (the sink interleaves), so the TX governor's `samples.len()`-based drain timing is unchanged; the silent 500&nbsp;ms lead-in is prepended in `android/mod.rs` via `config_state::digirig_tone()`. The L/R mapping is hard-pinned on Android (no output-channel selector, unlike desktop).

[`../../pkg/configstore/migrate.go`](../../pkg/configstore/migrate.go) (`migratePttAndroidMethodField`, v22);
[`../../pkg/modembridge/session.go`](../../pkg/modembridge/session.go) (`ConfigurePtt` construction, `PttMethod` field);
[`../../graywolf-modem/src/tx/ptt.rs`](../../graywolf-modem/src/tx/ptt.rs) (`PttMethod::Android` arm);
[`../../graywolf-modem/src/tx/ptt_android.rs`](../../graywolf-modem/src/tx/ptt_android.rs) (`AndroidPtt`, tone branch);
[`../../graywolf-modem/src/android/upcall.rs`](../../graywolf-modem/src/android/upcall.rs) (`jni_audio_set_tone`);
[`../../android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/nw5w/graywolf/audio/AudioTxPump.kt`](../../android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/nw5w/graywolf/audio/AudioTxPump.kt) (`setTone`, stereo render);
[`../../android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/nw5w/graywolf/audio/ToneOscillator.kt`](../../android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/nw5w/graywolf/audio/ToneOscillator.kt);
[`../../android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/nw5w/graywolf/usb/UsbPttAdapter.kt`](../../android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/nw5w/graywolf/usb/UsbPttAdapter.kt) (`pttSet`, `setAiocRts`).

*UI contract:* PTT configuration is operated only from the **PTT tab**
(`Ptt.svelte`) on both Android and desktop. The Channels page modal is
channel-only; an earlier PR-#157-era Android branch in
`ChannelEditModal.svelte` (`AndroidPttFields`) was removed in favor of
the unified tab. The Channels page's read-only PTT indicator row stays
— that's a glance-surface, not a config surface.

### 10. Gitignored output dirs are not canonical

*Why:* `target/`, `bin/`, `dist/`, `rust-bin/`, `rust-artifacts/`, `web/dist/`, `.worktrees/`, `.context/`, `*.db*` regenerate from sources and are gitignored, so never reference them as authoritative.

Source: [`../../.gitignore`](../../.gitignore);
[`build-pipelines.md`](build-pipelines.md).

### 11. Generated-bindings drift is enforced in CI

*Why:* `docs-check` and `api-client-check` regenerate to a tempdir and diff against committed copies, running inside `make go-test` and the pre-commit hook.

Source: [`../../Makefile`](../../Makefile),
[`../../.githooks/`](../../.githooks/), `make install-hooks`.

### 12. Web UI is embedded into the Go binary at compile time

*Why:* `go:embed all:dist` produces a self-contained binary, but the dir must exist at build time -- a placeholder `.keep` suffices until `npm run build` populates it.

Source: [`../../web/embed.go`](../../web/embed.go).

### 13. Modem readiness signal is on stdout, not the IPC channel

*Why:* The Go parent waits for `\n` (Unix) or `<port>\n` (Windows) on the modem's stdout before connecting, avoiding a connect-retry race against the bind.

Source: [`../../graywolf-modem/src/ipc/server.rs`](../../graywolf-modem/src/ipc/server.rs);
[`../../pkg/modembridge/`](../../pkg/modembridge/)
(`ipc_unix.go`, `ipc_windows.go`).

### 14. Version display string is shared across Go and Rust

*Why:* Both sides produce `v<Version>-<GitCommit>` and modembridge checks them at startup, so a mismatch immediately flags that the two halves of the build disagree.

Source:
[`../../cmd/graywolf/main.go`](../../cmd/graywolf/main.go),
[`../../pkg/app/config.go`](../../pkg/app/config.go),
[`../../graywolf-modem/build.rs`](../../graywolf-modem/build.rs).

### 15. IS->RF gating is a two-tier AND; default policy is deny

IS->RF transmission requires **both** tiers to allow a packet:

- **Tier 1 — hardcoded** (`Igate.shouldForwardISToRF`, `pkg/igate/igate.go`):
  directed messages only forward to an addressee heard **directly** on RF
  within `heardDirectTTL` (30 min, `pkg/igate/heard.go`); non-message
  traffic only forwards if sourced from one of the operator's own SSIDs
  (`sourceIsOwnSSID`). Not operator-configurable.
- **Tier 2 — the rule engine** (`filters.Engine.Allow`): priority-ordered,
  first-match-wins, **default deny**. Rule types: `callsign`, `prefix`,
  `message_dest`, `object`, `packet_type`. `packet_type` matches on the
  decoded `aprs.PacketType`; its Pattern is a fixed category key (`message`,
  `position`, `weather`, `object`, `item`, `telemetry`, `status`, `query`)
  mapped to the aprs.is `t/…` classes, not a wildcard string. The category
  set lives in `packetTypeCategories` (`pkg/igate/filters/filters.go`) and is
  mirrored as strings in the DTO validator (`packetTypeCategoryKeys`,
  `pkg/webapi/dto/igate.go`) and the Svelte `packetTypeOptions` — keep the
  three in sync. Messages-only IS→RF gating is one allow rule of type
  `packet_type` = `message` (graywolf #518).

A bare `*` pattern is a flooding footgun for source-side rules
(`callsign`/`prefix`) and a silent no-op elsewhere, so it is rejected —
**except for `message_dest`, where a bare `*` means "any addressee" and is
allowed**: tier 1's heard-direct check already bounds directed-message
delivery to stations physically heard on RF, so it cannot flood. This is
the one-rule way to get the textbook iGate "deliver to whoever we heard"
behavior (graywolf #496). The bare-`*` allowance is enforced in the engine
(`matches`), the DTO validator (`validateIGateRfFilterPattern`), and the
Svelte client mirror (`validatePattern`) — keep all three in sync.

The master IS->RF on/off switch is `IGateConfig.GateIsToRf`: when false the
TX governor is never wired into the iGate, so no packet reaches RF
regardless of the rule table (`buildIgateInstance` / `reloadIgate` in
`pkg/app/wiring.go`). It is surfaced as the "Enable IS→RF gating" toggle on
the iGate page's gating tab.

*Why:* preventing accidental flooding of RF with arbitrary internet traffic
while still allowing standard iGate message forwarding to be enabled in one
step.

Source: [`../../pkg/igate/filters/filters.go`](../../pkg/igate/filters/filters.go),
[`../../pkg/igate/igate.go`](../../pkg/igate/igate.go) (`shouldForwardISToRF`),
[`../../pkg/app/wiring.go`](../../pkg/app/wiring.go) (governor wiring).

### 16. TX path is single-source-of-truth via `txgovernor`

*Why:* Every TX origin (KISS, AGW, beacons, digipeater, iGate IS->RF) funnels through one Governor for per-channel rate limits, dedup, and priority -- new sources must route through it, not around.

Source: [`../../pkg/txgovernor/governor.go`](../../pkg/txgovernor/governor.go)
(package comment).

### 16b. KISS `tcp-client` defaults to a TX-capable TNC link

*Why:* A `tcp-client` KISS interface dials OUT to a hardware TNC, so its only useful default is `Mode=tnc` + `AllowTxFromGovernor=true` -- otherwise it registers no TX backend and silently transmits nothing while still receiving (issue #128). When `Mode` is **omitted from the request**, both the API boundary (`dto.KissRequest.ToModel`) and the store backstop (`normalizeKissInterface`) apply this default for `tcp-client` only; every other interface type keeps the historical `modem` default. An *explicitly supplied* `Mode` is always honored verbatim. Note `POST`/`PUT /api/kiss` is full-resource replace (`Store.UpdateKissInterface` does `db.Save`, like every DTO in the codebase): a `PUT` that omits `mode` re-applies the default exactly as create does -- it does NOT merge against the persisted row. This is consistent with how every other KISS field default (reconnect bounds, ingress rates) already behaves on `PUT`. The one hazardous case -- silently enabling TX on a `tcp-client` whose channel also has an audio input device (a modem backend), which would double-transmit -- cannot occur on either path: `validateKissInterface` independently rejects `tnc`+`AllowTxFromGovernor` on a modem-backed channel before the row is written. Migration 20 (`kiss_tcp_client_tx_default`) repairs pre-existing `tcp-client` rows stuck at the old `modem`/`false` default, and likewise skips any row whose channel has an audio input device.

Source: [`../../pkg/webapi/dto/kiss.go`](../../pkg/webapi/dto/kiss.go),
[`../../pkg/configstore/store.go`](../../pkg/configstore/store.go) (`normalizeKissInterface`),
[`../../pkg/configstore/migrate.go`](../../pkg/configstore/migrate.go) (`migrateKissTcpClientTxDefault`).

### 16c. `resolveTxChannel` honors KISS-TNC channels, not just modem channels

`App.resolveTxChannel` (`pkg/app/wiring.go`) picks the default TX egress channel for messages / iGate traffic. A channel is a valid egress target if it has **either** a modem input device (`Channel.InputDeviceID != nil`) **or** a KISS-TNC governor backend -- an enabled `Mode=tnc` interface with `AllowTxFromGovernor=true` and `Channel != 0`. The KISS-TNC set is computed by `kissTxChannelSet`, mirroring `buildTxBackendSnapshot`'s eligibility as a pure config projection (it does **not** require the interface's queue to be live, matching how the modem side ignores bridge-subprocess health). A configured channel that maps to either backend is returned as-is; otherwise the resolver falls back to the lowest modem channel, then to the lowest KISS-TNC channel, then to the lowest channel ID overall.

*Why:* A KISS-TNC channel legitimately has no `InputDeviceID`. The earlier modem-only resolver skipped it and silently overrode the operator's KISS channel to the first modem channel whenever both were configured, so messages routed to KISS were logged but egressed on the internal APRS modem (graywolf#503). Any change to what counts as a governor egress target must update `buildTxBackendSnapshot` and `kissTxChannelSet` together, or resolution and dispatch drift apart.

Source: [`../../pkg/app/wiring.go`](../../pkg/app/wiring.go) (`resolveTxChannel`, `kissTxChannelSet`, `buildTxBackendSnapshot`),
[`../../pkg/app/resolve_tx_channel_test.go`](../../pkg/app/resolve_tx_channel_test.go).

### 16d. A disabled channel (`Channel.Enabled == false`) is inert across every backend

`Channel.Enabled` (default true; column added by migration 29) is the single authoritative gate for whether graywolf brings a channel up. A disabled channel must be excluded at **every** place that enumerates channels for a backend, so it opens no device and moves no traffic:

- **Modem:** `pushConfiguration` (`pkg/modembridge/session.go`) filters disabled channels before emitting `ConfigureAudio` / `ConfigureChannel` / `ConfigurePtt`, so the Rust modem never opens the audio device or decodes the channel -- same treatment as the `InputDeviceID == nil` KISS-only skip.
- **Governor egress:** `buildTxBackendSnapshot`, `kissTxChannelSet`, and `resolveTxChannel` (`pkg/app/wiring.go`) skip disabled channels (`disabledChannelSet`), so a disabled channel is never a TX target -- neither its modem backend nor a KISS-TNC interface bound to it. This composes with invariant 16c: the disabled filter and the two egress projections must stay in lockstep.
- **KISS device:** a KISS interface whose `Channel` is disabled is stopped so its TNC device (serial fd / socket) is released. Boot goes through `kissComponent`; a live toggle goes through `webapi.notifyKissManager` (which re-reads the channel's enabled state) driven by `reconcileKissForChannel` on the channel update / enable-toggle handlers.

Toggling is hot: `PUT /api/channels/{id}/enabled` (and a full channel PUT) calls `notifyBridgeReload` (modem reconfigure + TX snapshot rebuild) and `reconcileKissForChannel`, so no restart is needed.

*Why:* The feature (graywolf#517) lets an operator park a channel -- e.g. an HF radio usually on voice -- without deleting its config. "Parked" only holds if the channel is inert on *all three* surfaces; a miss on any one leaves the device open or the channel silently egressing. Note the store-layer caveat: `Channel.Enabled` carries a `default:true` GORM tag, so `CreateChannel` cannot distinguish an explicit `false` from an unset zero value -- a create-disabled request is honored one layer up in `webapi.createChannel` off the request's `*bool`, and `dto.ChannelRequest.Enabled` is a pointer for the same reason.

Two deliberate scoping choices: (1) disabling does **not** trigger the channel-referrer guard (no 409) -- it is a reversible park with the config preserved, mirroring the unguarded KISS `setKissEnabled` toggle; `computeTxCapability` intentionally ignores `Enabled` so the guard fires only on real config changes (e.g. removing the output device), not on a park. (2) `computeChannelBacking` / `computeTxCapability` are config-level projections and also ignore `Enabled`; the disabled state is surfaced to the operator by the Channels page (`ChannelRow.svelte`: Disabled badge, dimmed card, a "Disabled" backing row in place of live/down) rather than by mutating those pure functions -- keeping them keyed only on backing config, not runtime enable state.

Source: [`../../pkg/modembridge/session.go`](../../pkg/modembridge/session.go) (`pushConfiguration`),
[`../../pkg/app/wiring.go`](../../pkg/app/wiring.go) (`disabledChannelSet`, `buildTxBackendSnapshot`, `kissTxChannelSet`, `resolveTxChannel`, `kissComponent`),
[`../../pkg/webapi/channels.go`](../../pkg/webapi/channels.go) (`setChannelEnabled`, `reconcileKissForChannel`, `createChannel`),
[`../../pkg/webapi/kiss.go`](../../pkg/webapi/kiss.go) (`notifyKissManager`).

### 17. RX fanout carries provenance via `ingress.Source` (in-process)

*Why:* Lets KISS broadcast suppress its own loopback without leaking a transport detail into the proto -- the provenance tag is in-process only, never on the wire.

Source: [`../../pkg/app/ingress/source.go`](../../pkg/app/ingress/source.go)
(package comment).

### 18. Generated artifacts that ship in commits

*Why:* CI's drift guards (see [invariant 11](invariants.md)) only work if regenerated copies are committed; bump targets stage them so each release tag includes them.

Files:
[`../../pkg/ipcproto/graywolf.pb.go`](../../pkg/ipcproto/graywolf.pb.go),
`pkg/webapi/docs/gen/swagger.{json,yaml}`,
[`../../web/src/api/generated/api.d.ts`](../../web/src/api/generated/api.d.ts),
[`../handbook/openapi.json`](../handbook/openapi.json),
[`../handbook/openapi.yaml`](../handbook/openapi.yaml).
Source: `GENERATED_SPEC_FILES` in [`../../Makefile`](../../Makefile).

### 19. APRS callsigns are NOT redacted by `graywolf flare`

*Why:* APRS callsigns are public ham-radio identifiers, and the entire purpose of a flare submission is to diagnose APRS issues. Redacting them would defeat the operator UI's correlation between flare config and observed packets.

Source: [`../../pkg/diagcollect/redact/doc.go`](../../pkg/diagcollect/redact/doc.go), enforced by `TestEngine_PreservesAPRSCallsigns`.

### 20. Hostname hash is consistent within one submission

*Why:* The hostname appears across many fields (system, log lines, file paths). Hashing it once per submission and substituting the same 8-hex tag everywhere preserves cross-references inside the operator UI without leaking the literal name.

Source: [`../../pkg/diagcollect/redact/hostname.go`](../../pkg/diagcollect/redact/hostname.go); the engine wires it through `SetHostname`.

### 21. Redaction always runs before review

*Why:* The review TUI is the user's audit step; the user can only audit what we're going to ship. Showing a pre-scrub payload would mean a user pressing 's' submits a different document than they reviewed.

Source: `pkg/diagcollect/Collect` calls `redact.ScrubFlare` before returning; the review TUI re-applies it after every ad-hoc rule add.

### 22. Review is mandatory for non-dry-run, non-`--out` invocations

*Why:* Anything that leaves the host across the network must pass through human eyes. `--dry-run` and `--out` print the same scrubbed payload, but only `--dry-run` skips the network -- and both still run the scrub.

Source: `cmd/graywolf/flare.go`'s control flow: the network `client.Submit` call is unreachable except through `runReviewLoop` returning `OutcomeSubmit`.

### 23. Channel mode gates TX, not RX

When a channel's `Mode` is `packet`, the beacon scheduler, digipeater engine, iGate IS→RF gate, APRS messages sender, and `ax25conn.Manager.Open` (connected-mode session bring-up) all skip, refuse, or down-shift when asked to transmit on that channel. Conversely, `ax25conn.Manager.Open` rejects channels in `aprs`-only mode. RX is unchanged: frames keep demodulating and fan out via the existing fanout; subscribers self-filter.

The lookup contract is fail-open at the resolver: if `ChannelModeLookup` returns an error or `nil`, callers behave as if the channel were `aprs` (preserves the legacy any-channel-does-anything behavior). The IS→RF runtime gate also fails open -- a transient DB error does not silently suppress beaconing or gating.

**Exception -- KISS `allow_connected_mode` passthrough.** The `aprs`-only refusal above is enforced by `ax25conn.Manager.Open` because that path *auto*-brings-up sessions (the web AX.25 terminal). The per-interface KISS `allow_connected_mode` opt-in (`pkg/kiss`, see [code-map](code-map.md)) is a *raw transport* path: it modulates client-supplied connected-mode frames directly via `Sink.Submit`, never touching `ax25conn.Manager`, so it does **not** consult `ChannelModeLookup`. An operator who sets `allow_connected_mode` on an interface mapped to an `aprs`-only channel can therefore transmit SABM/I/S frames there. This is deliberate: the flag is an explicit "stop filtering, KISS is a raw AX.25 transport" opt-in (graywolf#463), and the connecting client -- not graywolf -- owns the session. Default off keeps `aprs`-only channels connected-mode-free unless the operator overrides it.

*Why:* Operators may want to dedicate a channel to AX.25 connected-mode without it accidentally absorbing APRS beacons, digipeated packets, IS→RF traffic, or outbound APRS messages. The `aprs+packet` value preserves the legacy "any channel does anything" behavior for setups that don't care about the split.

### 24. AX.25 `link_stats` is emitted only while CONNECTED, 1Hz, never blocking

The `pkg/ax25conn` session goroutine arms a 1-second `tStats` timer on
the transition into `StateConnected` and stops it on every transition
out. Each tick refreshes `LinkStats` from the live session vars
(V(S)/V(R)/V(A), N2 retry count, busy flags, RTT EWMA) under the stats
mutex and emits one `OutLinkStats` event through the observer. The
bridge translates that to the `link_stats` envelope feeding the
TelemetryPanel.

The contract:

1. **Cadence is exactly 1Hz while CONNECTED.** No tick fires in
   DISCONNECTED, AWAITING_CONNECTION, AWAITING_RELEASE, or
   TIMER_RECOVERY -- only `setState(StateConnected)` arms the timer.
2. **Re-entry is harmless.** `setState` stops the timer on leaving
   CONNECTED before re-arming on the next entry, so a CONNECTED ->
   TIMER_RECOVERY -> CONNECTED bounce produces a single armed timer.
3. **Emit is non-blocking.** The observer call hits the same pump
   goroutine as every other `OutEvent`, and the pump non-blocking-sends
   to the WebSocket out-channel. A jammed browser never back-pressures
   the LAPB session goroutine.

*Why:* The telemetry panel must show useful RTT/sequence data without
ever stalling the LAPB timers. Tying the tick to a state-machine
event-bit (`pendStats`) instead of an external `time.Ticker` keeps the
session loop authoritative -- timer expiry races and CPU contention
can't spawn ghost ticks while the link is down.

### 25. Theme top-level rule must be `:root:root[data-theme="<id>"]`

Every CSS theme in `web/themes/` declares its variables under a
doubled `:root:root[data-theme="..."]` selector (specificity (0,2,1))
rather than the simpler `:root[data-theme="..."]` (0,1,1). Sub-rules
that target descendants (`:root[data-theme="X"] .badge`) are already
(0,1,2) and don't need the bump.

*Why:* `@chrissnell/chonky-ui` ships an OS-dark-mode fallback at
`@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) :root:not([data-theme="light"])`
with specificity (0,1,1). Vite bundles graywolf's theme stylesheets
*before* chonky-ui's, so on a specificity tie the chonky-ui rule wins
the cascade and clobbers any explicit graywolf theme whenever the OS
reports dark. The doubled `:root:root` lifts every graywolf theme one
notch above that fallback, so the operator's explicit choice always
beats the OS preference. Without this, Windows users with OS dark mode
could not switch back to a light graywolf theme.

### 26. Actions classifier consumes the packet

When the Actions classifier matches an inbound APRS message (addressee
in the trigger surface AND info-field begins with `@@`), the packet is
consumed before the messages router sees it. No `messages.in` row is
written for that packet. The classifier and the messages router share
one [`messages.Preflight`](../../pkg/messages/preflight.go) instance
constructed by `messages.Service`, so a consumed Actions packet still
gets an auto-ACK on every copy and a `(from, msgid, text_hash)` dedup
verdict — the first copy reaches the runner, every subsequent copy
within the dedup window is ACKed and silently dropped (APRS101 §14.2).

*Why:* Actions are operator-controlled command channels, not
correspondence; surfacing every Action invocation in the inbox would
clutter the operator's message view and break the audit-log-as-source-of-truth
contract for Actions traffic. Consumption is the cleanest cut. Sharing
the preflight closes the prior gap where action senders kept retrying
because no ACK ever arrived, and where iGate fan-out delivered N copies
that each fired the executor.

### 27. Inbound dedup + auto-ACK is centralized in `messages.Preflight`

Any new inbound discriminator that diverts traffic before
`messages.Router` (today only `actions.Classifier`) MUST send an
auto-ACK and consult the dedup ring via `messages.Preflight`, or
iGate-relayed duplicates will re-fire its handlers and the original
sender will retry forever.

### 28. iGate enable/disable is hot-reloadable; reload plumbing is unconditional

The iGate's reload signal channel (`a.igateReload`), the reload-drainer
goroutine, the RF→IS fanout adapter (`a.igateOut`, an `*igate.IgateOutput`
holding an `atomic.Pointer[Igate]`), and the live `IGateLineSender`
adapter passed to `messages.Service` (`a.igateLineSender`) are ALL
allocated at boot regardless of the persisted `IGateConfig.Enabled`
flag. `App.reloadIgate` then handles three transitions on every signal
from `signalIgateReload`:

1. **disabled → enabled**: build a fresh `*igate.Igate` via
   `App.buildIgateInstance`, store the pointer + propagate to
   `a.igateOut.SetIgate` and `beaconSched.SetISSink` BEFORE calling
   `Start`, then seed `lastAppliedIgateFilter`. A `Start` failure rolls
   all of those back to nil so a subsequent toggle gets a fresh build
   instead of trying to re-Start the dead instance.
2. **enabled → disabled**: `Stop` the current iGate, clear `a.ig` /
   `a.igateOut` / beacon ISSink, reset `lastAppliedIgateFilter`.
3. **enabled → enabled**: re-read filters/rules and call `Reconfigure`
   on the running iGate (skipping the reconnect when the composed
   filter is unchanged).

Consequence: `a.ig` is `atomic.Pointer[igate.Igate]`. Code paths that
read it MUST go through `a.ig.Load()` and tolerate a nil result —
captured method values (`a.ig.Status`, `a.ig.SetSimulationMode`) are
forbidden because they freeze a stale instance across toggles. The
status / simulation REST routes at `/api/igate*` and the
`SetIgateStatusFn` callback are registered unconditionally with
closures that re-load `a.ig` on every call.

The disabled-state HTTP contract is **503 "igate not available"**, not
200 with a Connected=false snapshot. `GET /api/igate` and the
`/api/status` aggregate's `igate` field both omit the body when the
status callback returns nil, and the simulation toggle returns
`igate.ErrNotEnabled` which `setIgateSimulation` maps to 503. The Svelte
"Disabled" badge logic in `web/src/routes/Igate.svelte` keys off a
non-2xx response — a 200 with `connected:false` would render a red
"Disconnected" badge for an iGate the operator deliberately turned off.

Repeated enable cycles must not orphan Prometheus collectors. On a
second-and-later `igate.New`, `initMetrics` rebinds `ig.m*` to the
already-registered collector via `prometheus.AlreadyRegisteredError.ExistingCollector`
so `/metrics` keeps reflecting live counter increments instead of
freezing at the first instance's values.

*Why:* graywolf issue #84 — toggling the Enable iGate switch on the
iGate page used to require a daemon restart. The reload signal
silently no-op'd (channel was nil when boot-time config was disabled)
and the reload path only ever ran `Reconfigure`, never `Stop` or build.

### 29. AX.25 callsigns are uppercased on decode

*Why:* APRS callsigns are uppercase alphanumeric per spec, but
non-conformant transmitters occasionally ship lowercase shifted bytes
in the address field. The text parser `ax25.ParseAddress` already
uppercases, but the binary `decodeAddress` path used for every RF
frame did not, so lowercase callsigns leaked through `pkt.Source`
into the station cache and message store. Normalizing at the single
binary-decode chokepoint keeps every downstream consumer (router,
station cache, persistInbound, digipeater) working from canonical
uppercase. Object and Item names are NOT normalized — APRS101 §11
defines them as case-sensitive free-form names, not callsigns.

### 30. Per-channel dashboard stats have two sources by backing

*Why:* The dashboard channel card RX/TX (`GET /api/status`,
`GET /api/channels/{id}/stats`) reads `modembridge` per-channel
counters, which are fed *only* by the Rust modem's `StatusUpdate`
IPC. KISS-TNC-backed channels have no Rust modem, so their card was
permanently stuck at zero even though the aggregate Prometheus
tiles incremented (issue #132). Per-channel counts for TNC-mode KISS
interfaces are therefore tracked separately in `kiss.Manager`: RX
via the wrapped `RxIngress` (per inbound frame, per interface); TX
via `txbackend.Dispatcher`'s `OnChannelTx` hook, called once per
dispatched frame on a KISS-backed channel, co-located with the
aggregate `ObserveTxFrame` so it stays in lockstep and does NOT
multiply by fan-out width when a channel has multiple KISS-TNC
interfaces attached. `webapi` prefers the bridge cache and falls
back to `kiss.Manager.ChannelStats` only when the bridge has no
entry. The TX-backend validator forbids a channel being both modem-
and KISS-backed, so the two sources never overlap and cannot
double-count (a modem-backed channel carries no KISS backend, so
`OnChannelTx` never fires for it). Bad-FCS is intentionally absent for KISS-TNC channels:
a hardware TNC validates the FCS and never forwards a bad frame over
KISS. Unlike the modem cache, the KISS counters are process-lifetime
monotonic and are NOT reset on a modem restart.

### 31. `aprs.Weather` holds raw APRS101 integers; unit conversion is the stationcache boundary's job

*Why:* The parser (`pkg/aprs/weather.go`) stores `Rain1Hour`,
`Rain24Hour`, `RainSinceMid` as raw hundredths-of-an-inch and
`Pressure` as raw tenths-of-millibar — a deliberate contract the FAP
conformance corpus enforces (`pkg/aprs/fap_corpus_test.go`, header
comment). Display-unit conversion happens exactly once, at
`convertWeather` in `pkg/stationcache/extract.go` (`/100` for rain,
`/10` for pressure). Snowfall is the lone exception: the parser
already divides it by 100, so `convertWeather` passes it through.
Adding a new WX field, or surfacing `RainSinceMid`, means converting
at that boundary — never assume the parser did it, and never add a
second `/100` downstream. The converted cache value flows unchanged
into `historydb` and the `webapi` WeatherDTO, and `historydb` is read
back into `stationcache.Weather` *without* re-running `convertWeather`
when the cache is hydrated on restart (`pkg/stationcache/persistent.go`)
— so persisted rows must already be in display units. Issue #126:
rain shipped 100x too large because this conversion was missing;
because legacy rows persisted the raw value, `bootstrap` carries a
one-time `PRAGMA user_version`-gated backfill
(`UPDATE weather SET rain_1h = rain_1h/100.0, rain_24h = rain_24h/100.0`,
`user_version` 0 → 1). `user_version` is the historydb data-migration
counter; bump it and add a gated block for any future persisted-units
correction.

### 32. Modem sample rate is capped at 48 kHz

The modem never advertises, defaults to, or opens an audio stream
above **48 kHz** (`audio::MODEM_MAX_SAMPLE_RATE`). Every Graywolf
modem mode (AFSK 1200, G3RUH 9600, QPSK/8-PSK) is well served by
48 kHz.

*Why:* An ALSA `plughw:`/`default` PCM advertises a *synthetic*
resample range (up to 192 kHz) via cpal `supported_*_configs()`
even though the USB codec hardware runs at 48 kHz. The Audio
Devices form used to auto-fill the **highest** advertised rate, so
operators who ran "Detect Devices" persisted `sample_rate=96000`.
At runtime the modem opened the stream at the inflated rate while
the hardware ran 48 kHz; the demodulator clocked AFSK bit timing
against the wrong rate and **every frame failed FCS -- RX went
silent with no error** (anguilla.local, 2026-05-16). Defense in
depth, all three layers required:

1. **Enumeration** never lists >48 kHz: `STANDARD_SAMPLE_RATES`
   stops at 48000, asserted by `audio::rate_invariants`.
2. **UI** never defaults to a corrupt/max rate:
   `pickDefaultSampleRate` prefers 48000 → 44100 → highest ≤48 kHz,
   never above; the manual rate `<Select>` offers no 96000.
3. **Runtime backstop**: `soundcard::choose_stream_rate` honors the
   requested rate only when ≤48 kHz *and* covered by a real
   supported range, else falls back to the device native rate
   clamped to the ceiling. `AudioSource.sample_rate` reports the
   rate **actually opened**, so the demod can never be silently
   desynced by a bad config again.

Migration 21 (`audio_devices_clamp_sample_rate`) repairs
already-corrupted field databases (`sample_rate > 48000 → 48000`).

### 33. Stream format is device-advertised, never `default_{input,output}_config()` (both RX and TX)

`soundcard::spawn` (capture) and `soundcard::spawn_output` (playback)
both pick the `SampleFormat` from the device's *advertised* supported
configs at the chosen rate, preferring native `I16`
(`pick_input_sample_format` / `pick_output_sample_format`, both ranked
by the shared `native_format_rank`). Neither path may open a stream
using `device.default_input_config().sample_format()` or
`device.default_output_config().sample_format()`; the cpal default is
only a last-resort fallback when the device advertises nothing usable
at the rate.

*Why:* On an ALSA `plughw:`/`default` PCM, cpal's
`default_input_config()` **and** `default_output_config()` return
**`F32`**. Opening an `F32` stream on a full-speed USB radio codec
(AIOC, Signalink, Digirig) makes cpal `alsa::poll()` return `POLLERR`
on essentially every period -- the holding thread rebuilds, POLLERRs
again, and loops forever, flooding the log. The *same hardware*
streams the native `I16` config cleanly (`arecord -f S16_LE` /
`aplay`).

This bit RX first: capture was observed looping 24,344 errors in one
session with RX stuck at zero and no fatal error. The capture fix
(`pick_input_sample_format`, commit `f917b8ff`) left `spawn_output`
still calling `default_output_config().sample_format()`, so the
identical failure resurfaced on **TX only** (issue #227: TX floods
`cpal output stream error: ... alsa::poll() returned POLLERR` while RX
is fine). `spawn_output` now selects the format the same way.

The detection probe (`pick_input_probe_config`) and both runtime
selectors share `native_format_rank`, so detection and runtime cannot
drift. The sample-*rate* clamp (invariant 32) is necessary but
independent: a clipping analog input or an `F32` plughw stream each
kill audio on their own.

### 34. KISS InterfaceType dispatch must be updated in two independent places

Adding or changing a KISS InterfaceType (e.g. `KissTypeSerial`) requires updating the `switch ki.InterfaceType` in **both**:

1. `pkg/app/wiring.go` -- `kissComponent().start` (startup dispatch)
2. `pkg/webapi/kiss.go` -- `notifyKissManager` (hot-reload / config-write dispatch)

The two switches are independent; omitting #2 means a config write calls `Stop()` on a running interface and silently leaves it stopped with no error.

*Why:* There is no shared dispatch table -- each switch is a separate match on the stored `InterfaceType` string, so a new type added to one switch must be consciously added to the other.

Source: [`../../pkg/app/wiring.go`](../../pkg/app/wiring.go) (`kissComponent`),
[`../../pkg/webapi/kiss.go`](../../pkg/webapi/kiss.go) (`notifyKissManager`).

### 35. All blocking Bluetooth and USB calls run on a worker thread

`BluetoothSocket.connect`, `BluetoothAdapter.bondedDevices`,
`BluetoothSocket.inputStream.read`, `UsbDeviceConnection.controlTransfer`,
`UsbDeviceConnection.bulkTransfer`, `UsbManager.openDevice`,
`UsbDeviceConnection.claimInterface`, and HID Set_Report calls are blocking
JNI/native invocations. Main-thread invocation can block UI for several
seconds the first time the corresponding stack is touched, leading to ANR
("Application Not Responding") dialogs on Android.

*Why:* feedback memory `feedback_android_usb_open_worker_thread` -- phase-4b
USB enumeration on the main thread caused a 5-second ANR. The lesson is
general to any blocking native call.

*How to apply:* Kotlin code touching `BluetoothAdapter`, `BluetoothSocket`,
`UsbDeviceConnection`, `UsbSerialAdapter`, `UsbSerialFacade`, or `HidDevice`
MUST dispatch onto an IO/worker dispatcher (`Dispatchers.IO`, a dedicated
`SingleThreadExecutor`, or a worker `Thread`). Calls arriving FROM the
`@JavascriptInterface` binder thread that need a main-thread API surface
(`requestPermissions` etc.) may `mainHandler.post { ... }` only that
AndroidManifest-API call; the actual blocking work still belongs on a
worker thread.

### 36. The Android Go child dies with the app (two-layer shutdown)

*Why:* Swiping the app from recents removes the Activity but, with
`android:stopWithTask` at its default (`false`), the foreground service keeps
running -- so the forked Go backend would keep iGating/beaconing and the next
launch shows stale uptime. A hard kill (Force Stop / OOM / OEM killer) can
orphan the Go child entirely. Two independent layers guarantee the child
cannot outlive the app, because no single mechanism covers both cases.

*How to apply:*
- **Layer 1 (clean swipe):** `GraywolfService.onTaskRemoved` calls `stopSelf()`,
  which runs the existing `onDestroy()` teardown (`supervisor.stop()`,
  `goLauncher.stop()` -> SIGTERM, `ModemBridge.modemStop()`, audio pumps,
  `UsbPttAdapter.closeAll()`, `platformServer.stop()`). Keep `stopWithTask`
  **unset** (default false) so `onTaskRemoved` is delivered; do NOT set
  `android:stopWithTask="true"` -- the implicit stop is historically flaky
  across OEMs and skips the deterministic log line.
  - **USB auto-relaunch suppression:** `MainActivity` declares a
    `USB_DEVICE_ATTACHED` intent-filter so plugging in a radio launches the app.
    Tearing down on swipe releases the radio's USB interfaces, which physically
    re-enumerate (~2s later, new bus device numbers) -- indistinguishable from a
    fresh plug-in, so Android would auto-relaunch and revive the station the
    operator just dismissed. To prevent that, `onTaskRemoved` records a
    deliberate-stop timestamp (`MainActivity.markUserStopped`, in `graywolf-prefs`)
    and `MainActivity.onCreate` `finish()`es immediately if the launch action is
    `USB_DEVICE_ATTACHED` within `STOP_RELAUNCH_SUPPRESS_WINDOW_MS` (15s) of that
    stop. A launcher tap (action `MAIN`) or a genuine re-plug after the window is
    NOT suppressed; the marker is cleared in `startEverything()`. The window
    (not a one-shot) is required because re-enumeration fires one attach per
    interface (e.g. CP2102N serial + C-Media audio).
- **Layer 2 (hard-kill safety net):** `watchParentDeath` in
  `cmd/graywolf/parentwatch.go` cancels the app context when the parent dies,
  via two triggers -- stdin EOF (the JVM holds the write end of the child's
  stdin pipe; the kernel closes it on app death) and a reparent poll
  (`os.Getppid()` changes when the child reparents to init). A deadline
  `os.Exit` backstops a hung unwind. This is separate from the stdout
  readiness channel ([invariant 13](invariants.md)) -- stdin carries death
  detection, stdout carries readiness; different fds, no conflict. The modem
  cdylib is in-process JNI, so it always dies with the app -- no separate
  handling needed.
- **Single backend, serialized startup:** the platformsvc socket
  (`<cacheDir>/platform.sock`, Linux abstract namespace) is effectively the
  station's single-instance lock. A new instance must not start its backend
  while a previous one is still tearing down. `MainActivity.waitForPredecessorThenStart`
  probes the socket on a background thread (a live predecessor still accepts a
  `LocalSocket` connect) and shows a "waiting" page until it is free, then starts
  the foreground service. `PlatformServer.start()` additionally retries the bind
  for `BIND_WAIT_MS` and, on timeout, throws `BindContendedException` so
  `GraywolfService.onCreate` `stopSelf()`s cleanly -- it never lets
  `Address already in use` crash the process, because that crash relaunches and
  re-collides, a loop that re-enumerates the USB bus fast enough to wedge devices
  off a powered hub.
- **No blocking HAL calls on the main thread in `onCreate`:** `AudioTxPump.start()`
  (AudioTrack build + `setPreferredDevice`) and `UsbPttAdapter.enumerate()` (USB
  device opens) are synchronous HAL/binder calls that block for seconds when a USB
  audio dongle is wedged, ANR'ing the process within ~5s. `GraywolfService.onCreate`
  runs them on a `graywolf-io-init` worker thread (the modem TX/PTT callbacks are
  installed first and tolerate the brief gap); `onDestroy` joins that worker
  (bounded) before tearing the same resources down. The cheap `UsbPttAdapter.init()`
  stays on the main thread so `MainActivity.onResume`'s `enumerate()` never races an
  uninitialized adapter.
- **Inset ownership is split: top in CSS, bottom in native padding (edge-to-edge + keyboard):**
  `targetSdk=36` forces edge-to-edge on Android 15+, where the platform no longer
  auto-insets the content view or resizes the window for the soft keyboard.
  `MainActivity.applyWindowInsets` calls `WindowCompat.setDecorFitsSystemWindows(window, false)`
  and a `setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener` that pads the WebView by the side/bottom
  navigation bars and `max(navBars.bottom, ime.bottom)` -- but **leaves the top inset at
  0 on purpose**. The inset types used are `statusBars()` for the status bar and
  `navigationBars()` for the nav bar -- NOT the combined `systemBars()`, which some OEM
  ROMs under-report when `setDecorFitsSystemWindows(false)` is set.
  The split is load-bearing and not interchangeable:
  - **Top is owned by CSS, fed the inset by native.** The SPA's mobile top bar is
    `position:fixed; top:0` (`web/.../Sidebar.svelte`), and a fixed element is pinned to
    the visual viewport, which WebView top-padding does NOT shift -- padding the top leaves
    the bar stranded behind the status bar (GH #390). So the top bar reserves the
    status-bar strip in CSS (`height: calc(56px + var(--safe-area-top))`, matching
    `margin-top` on `.main-content`). The value is **not** taken from
    `env(safe-area-inset-top)` alone: Android WebView derives that env var from the
    display cutout, not the status bar, and returns 0 (or wrong values below WebView 140)
    on most devices -- relying on it is what made the first GH #390 fix regress. Instead
    `MainActivity.applyTopInsetToCss` injects the real status-bar inset (`statusBars.top`,
    converted to CSS px) as the `--android-inset-top` custom property on the document root,
    re-applied from `onPageFinished` because each `loadUrl` swaps in a fresh document.
    `web/src/app.css` defines `--safe-area-top: max(env(safe-area-inset-top),
    var(--android-inset-top, 0px))` so the Android shell (var set, env 0) and iOS / mobile
    browsers (env populated, var unset) both reserve the strip; all top-inset consumers
    (`App.svelte`, `Sidebar.svelte`, `RemoteActionsDrawer.svelte`) read `var(--safe-area-top)`.
    chonky-ui's `<Drawer>` (the mobile nav drawer, `web/.../Sidebar.svelte` `anchor="left"`)
    bakes raw `env(safe-area-inset-top)` into its `.drawer` rule, so `app.css` overrides
    `.drawer { padding-top: var(--safe-area-top) }` to feed it the native inset too -- the
    proper fix belongs in chonky-ui itself; until then any new `.drawer`-based surface
    inherits the override. Do NOT re-add `bars.top` to the WebView padding, do NOT make the
    top bar depend on `env(safe-area-inset-top)` directly, and keep `viewport-fit=cover` in
    `web/index.html` (it is still needed for the env() path on iOS / mobile browsers).
  - **Bottom is split: keyboard owned by native padding; navigation bar owned by CSS.**
    `env()` cannot express the keyboard, so `max(navBars.bottom, ime.bottom)` native padding
    on the WebView is the keyboard load-bearing bit: it shrinks the web viewport above the
    keyboard so the SPA's sticky compose bar (`web/.../ComposeBar.svelte`,
    `position:absolute; bottom:0`) is never covered. That component skips its own
    `visualViewport` translateY when `Platform.isAndroid` so the two mechanisms don't
    stack into a double-offset; the web translate stays the path for mobile browsers.
    For `position:fixed` elements such as chonky-ui toasts, native WebView padding does
    NOT reliably shrink `window.innerHeight` (it only works for the keyboard via
    `adjustResize`). On Android with 3-button navigation, `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` is
    also 0 (the nav bar is opaque). `MainActivity.applyBottomInsetToCss` therefore injects
    `navBars.bottom` (in CSS px) as `--android-inset-bottom`; `app.css` defines
    `--safe-area-bottom: max(env(safe-area-inset-bottom), var(--android-inset-bottom, 0px))`
    and overrides `.toast { bottom: calc(1.5rem + var(--safe-area-bottom, 0px)) }` so toasts
    clear the nav bar. Any new fixed-bottom element must read `--safe-area-bottom` for the
    same reason.
  The manifest's `android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize"` is the pre-API-30 fallback:
  there `WindowInsetsCompat.Type.ime()` reports 0, so adjustResize resizes the decor
  frame instead, re-firing the same listener -- do NOT drop it assuming the inset path
  covers 28-29. The WebView background is painted `@color/chrome_bg` (the single source
  the theme's `statusBarColor` also uses) so the padded bar strips don't flash white.
  Do NOT revert to letting the system manage insets -- on Android 15+ the compose bar
  disappears behind the keyboard.

### 37. The Android modem never goes permanently deaf (IPC re-accept + no-halt supervisor)

*Why:* Two independent failure modes used to leave the modem alive but RX
permanently dead -- no levels, no decode -- while audio capture stayed healthy:
(1) the Rust `run_demod` outbound loop did a bare `break` on the first IPC send
error, exiting the serve loop and silently dropping every frame + level while the
DSP thread kept draining audio; (2) the Kotlin `Supervisor` permanently halted its
restart loop after 3 failures in 60s (or any `onRestart` returning false), so a
transient burst left the station deaf with no path to recovery.

*How to apply:*
- **Modem IPC re-accepts, it does not exit.** `run_demod` wraps the per-connection
  serve loop in an outer `'serve` loop that calls
  `IpcServer::accept_interruptible(&stop, poll)`. On any send error (frame, level,
  or status) the inner loop breaks with `link_alive = true`, tears down just that
  connection (`drop(handle)` + join the reader), and loops back to await the Go
  child's reconnect. The DSP thread keeps decoding throughout. Only a `stop`
  request or a disconnected audio channel exits `run_demod` (the single exit path,
  which now also `stop.store(true)` before `dsp_join.join()` to fix a latent
  DSP-thread hang).
- **`ready` stays true across reconnects.** It is set true once at IPC bind and set
  false only on the real exit path -- never on a mere client reconnect -- so the
  Kotlin `modemWatcher` (which polls `modemAwaitReady`) does NOT trigger a full
  modem restart just because the Go child reconnected.
- **`accept_interruptible` is stop-aware.** It polls the listener non-blocking so a
  `modemStop` is honored while waiting for reconnect; it returns `Ok(None)` when
  `stop` is set before any client connects. The blocking `accept` and the
  interruptible variant share `finish_accept` (sends `ModemReady`, spawns the
  reader thread).
- **Supervisor degrades, never halts.** Restart-decision logic lives in the pure,
  host-testable `RestartPolicy` (sliding 60s window). Inside the window it escalates
  through a backoff curve; once the limit is exceeded it enters DEGRADED mode and
  keeps retrying at a long capped delay instead of returning from the restart
  thread. An `onRestart` that returns false re-signals for another attempt rather
  than halting. `GraywolfService` surfaces degraded state as an Android notification
  ("graywolf modem stopped ... auto-retrying") via `onDegraded`, cleared on
  `onHealthy`.
- **Diagnosability:** when the DSP decodes but no IPC client is draining, dropped
  frames are counted and a `warn!` fires every 50 drops -- a deaf-but-decoding modem
  is visible in logcat instead of silent.

### 38. A USB device claimed for KISS serial cannot simultaneously be a PTT device (Android)

A CP210x or CH34x USB cable can act as either a PTT keying device
(via `UsbPttAdapter`) or a serial KISS TNC (via `UsbSerialAdapter`), but
not both at once.

*Why:* Both paths open the same `UsbDeviceConnection`. Concurrent ownership
would cause control-transfer collisions and undefined PTT state.

*How it is enforced:*
1. When `UsbSerialFacade.open(device)` is called to attach a KISS interface,
   it calls `UsbDeviceArbiter.claim(device)`, which calls
   `UsbPttAdapter.evictDevice(device)` to close and release any existing PTT
   connection on that device before the serial port is opened.
2. `UsbPttAdapter.tryOpen(device)` consults `UsbDeviceArbiter.isClaimed(device)`
   and refuses to open a device that is currently held by the KISS path.
3. When the KISS interface is stopped or reconfigured, `UsbSerialFacade`
   calls `UsbDeviceArbiter.release(device)` so the device becomes available
   for PTT again.

CDC-ACM devices (TH-D75, AIOC, Mobilinkd) are not affected: KISS takes full
ownership of the device and PTT is handled by the TNC hardware or inside the
KISS stream itself -- there is no separate PTT claim on a CDC-ACM device
that could conflict.

### 39. The CW test signal never keys the radio with an empty or N0CALL callsign

`POST /api/channels/{id}/test-tx` with `signal=cw` resolves the station
callsign via `Store.ResolveStationCallsign` and returns 422 before any IPC if
it is empty or N0CALL. The tone signals (`tone1200`, `tone2400`, `alt`) do not
use the callsign.

*Why:* A CW ID that transmits nothing (or the literal string "N0CALL") gives
no useful identification and violates the intent of the feature.

Source: [`../../pkg/webapi/channels.go`](../../pkg/webapi/channels.go)
(`sendTestSignal`).

### 40. Digipeater block list is digipeater-only

[`pkg/digipeater/blocklist`](../../pkg/digipeater/blocklist) is consulted
only by [`pkg/digipeater/digipeater.go`](../../pkg/digipeater/digipeater.go)'s
`Handle`. Frames whose source matches an enabled entry are not digipeated;
every other RX consumer (iGate, packet log, dashboard, station cache,
messages router, AGW/KISS fanouts) is unaffected and still sees the frame.

*Why:* operators commonly want to silence a misbehaving station's
digipeated copies without losing the ability to see, log, or gate that
station's original RF or APRS-IS appearances. A shared "blocked
stations" surface across subsystems would conflate two different
operator intents.

*How to apply:* never import `pkg/digipeater/blocklist` outside
`pkg/digipeater/`. If another subsystem grows a similar need, give it
its own list. The regression test in
[`pkg/app/wiring_blocklist_isolation_test.go`](../../pkg/app/wiring_blocklist_isolation_test.go)
locks the invariant in behaviorally.

### 41. The live map measures packet age against the host clock, not the browser's

Packet receive times (`last_heard`) and every other server timestamp are
stamped by the **graywolf host** clock. The browser must therefore compute
packet age relative to that same clock, never its own `Date.now()` —
otherwise a host whose clock is unsynced (a Pi with no RTC, a browser that
has drifted off NTP) makes ages go negative or silently hides every station
from the map (GH #234).

[`web/src/lib/map/clock-offset.svelte.js`](../../web/src/lib/map/clock-offset.svelte.js)
reads the standard HTTP `Date:` header off each `/api/stations` response
(`clockOffset.observe`), derives `offsetMs = serverNow - browserNow`, and
exposes `serverNow() ≈ Date.now() + offsetMs`. The two age-math sites use it:
the prune cutoff in
[`data-store.svelte.js`](../../web/src/lib/map/data-store.svelte.js)
(`pruneStale`) and `timeAgo` in
[`popup-helpers.js`](../../web/src/lib/map/popup-helpers.js).

*Why:* the host stamps the timestamps, so the host clock is the only shared
reference; correcting the browser to it (rather than the reverse) keeps every
connected browser consistent even when their clocks disagree with each
other. No new endpoint or protocol — the `Date` header is already on the wire.

*How to apply:* never reintroduce `Date.now()` for map packet-age math; route
it through `clockOffset.serverNow()`. The opposite case — timing a
*browser-local* event, e.g. "last fetch N ago" — must pass `Date.now()`
explicitly as `timeAgo`'s second arg to opt out of the host correction.

### 42. Hop count excludes generic path aliases

The displayed "hop" count for a station/packet is the number of *real*
digipeaters that retransmitted it, not the number of path elements with
the H-bit set (`*`). Generic routing aliases — `WIDE`, `RELAY`, `TRACE`,
the APRS-IS `qA*` constructs, and the IS-injection markers `TCPIP` /
`TCPXX` — are excluded even when flagged used,
because a used alias rides alongside the digipeater that consumed it
rather than being a hop of its own. Example: `SHEPRD*,WIDE1*,ELY*,WIDE2*`
is **2** hops (SHEPRD, ELY), not 4.

*Why:* counting raw `*` elements over-reported hops on the map station
view (GitHub issue #222) — WIDEn-N aliases left in the path by callsign-
inserting digipeaters were each tallied as a separate repeat.

*How to apply:* route any hop-counting or last-digipeater logic through
[`aprs.CountHops`](../../pkg/aprs/path.go) /
[`aprs.IsGenericPathAlias`](../../pkg/aprs/path.go) — the single source
of truth for which path entries are real hops. The map's `hops` field is
computed once in [`pkg/stationcache/extract.go`](../../pkg/stationcache/extract.go)
and consumed verbatim by the frontend popup; do not recompute it from
`path.length` client-side.

### 43. 64-bit atomic counters must be `atomic.Uint64`, not bare `uint64`

Any struct field touched by a 64-bit atomic operation must use the
`atomic.Uint64` / `atomic.Int64` types, never a plain `uint64` accessed via
`atomic.AddUint64`/`atomic.LoadUint64`. On 32-bit platforms (notably ARMv6 --
the Raspberry Pi Zero), a 64-bit atomic op requires the address to be 8-byte
aligned; a bare `uint64` sitting mid-struct on a 4-byte boundary is not
guaranteed to be, and the op panics with `unaligned 64-bit atomic operation`.
The `atomic.Uint64` wrapper carries an alignment guarantee, so the compiler
places it correctly regardless of field order. The iGate's four packet
counters (`statGated`, `statDownlinked`, `statFiltered`, `statDropped` in
[`pkg/igate/igate.go`](../../pkg/igate/igate.go)) are the canonical example.

*Why:* graywolf issue #262 -- on a Pi Zero the iGate connected to APRS-IS fine
but the web UI showed "Disabled" because `handleISLine`'s first
`atomic.AddUint64` panicked on the misaligned `statFiltered`, crash-looping the
process roughly every 90 seconds so the UI never observed a healthy session.
64-bit hosts are unaffected, which is why it slipped through.

*How to apply:* declare any atomically-accessed 64-bit counter as
`atomic.Uint64`/`atomic.Int64` and use the method API (`.Add(1)`, `.Load()`,
`.Store()`). Do not reintroduce bare `uint64` + `atomic.AddUint64`, and do not
rely on field ordering for alignment.

### 44. Every Go→Rust IPC payload must be dispatched in BOTH modem loops

The desktop/server modem and the Android modem read the same
`graywolf.proto` IPC stream through **two independent dispatch matches**,
and a Go→Rust payload only works on a platform whose match has an arm for
it:

1. `graywolf-modem/src/modem/mod.rs` — `handle_message` (desktop, server, the cdylib's non-Android path)
2. `graywolf-modem/src/android/mod.rs` — the inbound `while let` in `run_demod` (Android)

Both end in a catch-all (`_ => {}` / the grouped Rust→Go ignore arm), so a
new payload added to one loop but not the other is **silently dropped** on
the platform that missed it — no error, no log, just a Go-side request that
never gets its reply and times out.

*Why:* this has bitten twice. 5d6b75ad wired `ConfigurePtt` / `ManualPtt` /
`TransmitFrame` into `run_demod` after they were found dropped on Android
(PTT stayed silent); then `TransmitTestSignal` (the Channel TX test-signal
feature, #193) shipped to the desktop loop only and fell into the Android
catch-all, so **Test TX** returned `modembridge: test signal timeout` on
Android (#267). Same failure mode as invariant #34 (KISS dispatch in two
places), but across the Go↔Rust boundary.

*How to apply:* when you add a Go→Rust `Payload` variant, add a matching
arm to **both** loops in the same change — and on Android remember to send
the corresponding Rust→Go reply (e.g. `TestSignalResult`) so the Go side's
bounded wait resolves. Android TX jobs submit samples unscaled (gain is
applied by `AndroidTxSink`), unlike the desktop arm which pre-scales by the
output device gain.

### 45. Disabling a KISS interface releases its device; the DTO flag is a pointer

A KISS interface row carries `Enabled` (`KissInterface.Enabled`,
gorm `default:true`). When `Enabled=false` the manager does **not** keep
the device open looping reconnect attempts — it stops the supervisor,
which cancels the serve context and closes the underlying
`io.ReadWriteCloser` (the serial fd / TCP socket). This is what lets an
operator release e.g. a Bluetooth `/dev/rfcomm0` tty before a battery
swap without deleting the interface (graywolf #152). Three call sites
already honor the flag and must stay in sync — they are the same
two-switch dispatch as invariant #34 plus the TX snapshot:

1. `pkg/app/wiring.go` — `kissComponent().start` skips `!Enabled` rows at boot.
2. `pkg/webapi/kiss.go` — `notifyKissManager` calls `kissManager.Stop(id)` (release) on `!Enabled`, and (re)starts on `Enabled`. The focused `PUT /api/kiss/{id}/enabled` toggle (`setKissEnabled`) routes through here.
3. `pkg/app/wiring.go` — `buildTxBackendSnapshot` excludes `!Enabled` rows so a disabled TNC registers no governor TX backend.

*notifyKissManager must enumerate the same interface types as the boot
switch* (this is invariant #34's two-switch hazard in practice). The
re-enable path goes through `notifyKissManager`, so its `switch` needs a
case for **every** type `kissComponent` can start — `tcp`, `tcp-client`,
`serial`, `bluetooth`, `usbserial`. A type that falls into `default:`
hits `Stop(id)` and silently never restarts on re-enable (this bit
Bluetooth/USB: they were missing and re-enable was a no-op). The
serial-family cases (`serial`/`bluetooth`/`usbserial`) must also pass
`OpenFunc: s.kissSerialOpenFunc` — on Android that opener routes MAC /
vid:pid device strings through `platformsvc`; without it the supervisor
cannot open the device. The webapi `Server` receives it via
`Config.KissSerialOpenFunc` (wired from `App.kissSerialOpenFunc()`; nil
on desktop).

*Why a pointer:* `dto.KissRequest.Enabled` is `*bool`, not `bool`. KISS
`POST`/`PUT` is full-resource replace (invariant at line ~185), so a
plain `bool` would conflate "field omitted" with "disable" and an older
client editing any field would silently stop the interface. `nil` means
"omitted → default true"; `ToModel` substitutes the explicit value. The
frontend always sends `enabled` on save so a `PUT` never re-enables a row
the operator disabled.

*Create vs. the gorm default:* the `default:true` tag is kept (so the SQL
DDL default survives for raw inserts / downgrade-safety — `migrate_kiss_*`
tests rely on it). But gorm treats a Go zero-value `bool` as "unset" and
sends the column default on `INSERT`, so a `POST` with `enabled=false`
would otherwise persist `true` (the footgun the `actions` table dodged by
dropping its tag default). `Store.CreateKissInterface` therefore captures
the requested value *before* `db.Create` (gorm writes the applied default
back into the struct) and re-asserts `false` with an explicit `Update`.
`UpdateKissInterface` (`db.Save`) writes `false` correctly on its own, so
only the create path needs the fix-up.

### 46. Per-frame metadata must be populated by every demod profile, not just Profile A

The default AFSK RX path is the `RECOMMENDED_3DEMOD` ensemble (Profile A,
Profile A + hard-limiter, Profile B / FM-discriminator). The ensemble dedups
identical frames across sub-demods and keeps the *first* emitter within a
~110-sample window; in practice **Profile B usually wins** because its
pipeline detects the closing flag a few samples earlier. So any per-frame
field stamped onto `DecodedFrame` (e.g. `audio_level_mark`/`space`) must be
produced by *all three* profiles -- a field tracked only in
`process_profile_a` will be the `-1.0`/zero init on the frames that actually
reach the application, even though Profile A "also" decoded the packet.

This bit the per-packet audio level (GRA-84): Profile B never called
`track_level`, so nearly every logged packet showed no level (a dash) until
Profile B was taught to track a level. Profile B decodes through a single
center-frequency oscillator, so it first copied that one envelope into both
the mark and space peaks -- which left them always equal and hid the
mark/space twist Direwolf reports (graywolf #324 / GRA-130). It now runs a
parallel mark/space oscillator pair (matching Profile A's mix -> low-pass ->
envelope path) purely for metering, so the two tones are measured
independently; the FM-discriminator decode path is unchanged. When adding a
new per-frame measurement, populate it in `process_profile_a` **and**
`process_profile_b`, or compute it profile-independently.

### 47. The GPS serial reader must deassert RTS/DTR on open

`gps.RunSerial` opens its NMEA port with
`InitialStatusBits: &serial.ModemOutputBits{RTS: false, DTR: false}`. This is
not optional cosmetics: opening a tty otherwise leaves RTS and DTR raised
(`go.bug.st/serial` only touches the modem bits when `InitialStatusBits` is
non-nil, and the kernel asserts both on open by default). On shared serial
rigs where RTS drives PTT -- the Digirig Mobile RS232 is the canonical case --
raised RTS keys the transmitter the instant GPS connects, producing a
persistent PTT that can't be toggled off (issue #305). GPS only consumes RX,
so it holds the control lines low and leaves RTS for the PTT driver to assert
when it keys. macOS does not exhibit this because its tty open does not raise
the lines the same way, which is why the bug was Linux-only.

Source: [`../../pkg/gps/serial.go`](../../pkg/gps/serial.go) (`RunSerial`).

### 47a. The GPS serial reader must NOT hold the tty exclusively (Linux)

On Linux `gps.RunSerial` opens the NMEA port through `openNMEASerial`
(`serial_open_linux.go`), a raw `unix.Open` + termios path that deliberately
does **not** issue `TIOCEXCL`. `go.bug.st/serial` acquires exclusive access on
every Unix open (`acquireExclusiveAccess` -> `TIOCEXCL`), which blocks any
later `open()` of the same tty with `EBUSY` for non-`CAP_SYS_ADMIN` callers.
On a shared serial rig (Digirig Mobile: radio NMEA in on RX, PTT on RTS over
the same DB9), the GPS reader (Go parent) and the PTT driver (graywolf-modem
child, `ptt_unix.rs` -> `open(O_RDWR|O_NOCTTY|O_NONBLOCK|O_CLOEXEC)`) both open
the same device. Whichever opens first wins; if GPS won and held `TIOCEXCL`,
the modem's PTT `open()` failed with `EBUSY` and PTT silently never worked.
This was order-dependent, so it surfaced as "PTT works when I configure it but
breaks after a reboot" -- on reboot both routines start concurrently and GPS
frequently wins the race (issue GRA-118 / #305 follow-up). The Linux opener
keeps the #47 RTS/DTR deassert but drops the exclusive lock so the PTT driver
can always open the device. Non-Linux platforms keep the `go.bug.st/serial`
path (`serial_open_other.go`); the shared-line scenario is Linux-only.

The Linux reader uses `VMIN=0` with a `poll()`-driven timeout so `Read`
returns `(0, nil)` on timeout (what the `timeoutReader` scanner expects) and a
self-pipe so `Close` wakes a blocked read without closing the device fd out
from under it (avoiding an fd-reuse race).

### 48. "Direct RX" is a time-windowed filter, backed by a sticky-but-timestamped direct hearing

The Live Map "Direct RX" filter shows a station only if it was heard directly
on RF (RX, zero digi hops) **within the selected time range** -- not merely if
it has *ever* been heard directly. Two pieces enforce this and must stay in
sync:

- `stationcache` records `Station.LastDirectHeard` -- the timestamp of the most
  recent direct reception. It is set in `updateMetadata` only when
  `isDirectRF(direction, hops)` is true, and is **never** advanced by a
  digipeated, gated, or IS copy. The static-rebeacon merge keeps the most
  RF-reachable reception metadata via `rfRank` (issue #130, so a direct copy is
  not masked by a later digipeated one) **but advances the fix's `Timestamp` to
  the latest beacon** -- so the fix's own timestamp is *not* a reliable "when
  heard directly". `LastDirectHeard` is the authoritative answer and is exposed
  as `last_direct_heard` in `StationDTO`. It stores the packet's `Timestamp`
  (`e.Timestamp` -- embedded APRS timestamp if present, otherwise decode/receive
  time), consistent with per-position trail timestamps, **not** the server
  receive clock that stamps `LastHeard`. For the common position packet (no
  embedded timestamp) the two coincide; only packets carrying an explicit APRS
  timestamp can diverge, by the sender's TNC clock skew.

- The frontend predicate `directHeardWithin(station, cutoffMs)`
  (`web/src/lib/map/direct-rx-core.js`) qualifies a station only when
  `last_direct_heard >= serverNow() - timerangeMs`. `isDirectRx` in
  `LiveMapV2.svelte` builds the cutoff from `clockOffset.serverNow()` and the
  active time range.

*Why:* a mobile station heard directly earlier in the day but only via a
digipeater recently must drop out of Direct RX once the direct hearing ages
past the window (issue #349). Classifying off the position's direction/hops
alone -- the old behavior -- kept it visible forever because issue #130's merge
keeps the direct copy sticky.

*How to apply:* never advance `LastDirectHeard` on a non-direct reception, and
never re-derive "heard directly within range" from a position's `Direction`/
`Hops`/`Timestamp` -- those describe the *displayed* fix, not when the station
was last heard directly. `LastDirectHeard` is in-memory only; it is not yet
persisted in `historydb`, so after a restart a station re-qualifies for Direct
RX only once it is heard directly again.

### 49. `world` is a legitimate bare offline-map slug -- never namespace it

The offline-map slug grammar (`pkg/mapsslug`) is namespaced -- `state/<x>`,
`country/<iso2>`, `province/<iso2>/<x>` -- with exactly one bare exception: the
single global archive `world`. The frontend region picker
(`web/src/lib/maps/catalog-tree.js`, `buildWorldNode`) hardcodes this `world`
slug, and the backend keys the DB row and the on-disk `world.pmtiles` by it.

The two startup migrations that namespace **legacy** bare slugs predate the
world archive (added in #277) and must explicitly skip `world`:

- `Store.MigrateMapsDownloadSlugs` (`pkg/configstore/migrate_downloads.go`)
  prepends `state/` to any DB slug lacking `/`.
- `Manager.MigrateLegacyArchives` (`pkg/mapscache/manager.go`) moves any bare
  `<x>.pmtiles` into `state/<x>.pmtiles`.

*Why:* before the skip, every restart rewrote a downloaded `world` row+file to
`state/world`. Offline rendering still worked (row and file moved together), but
the picker's `statusOf('world')` lookup missed, so it showed a Download button
for an already-downloaded world map (GH #364). Both migrations now also repair
an existing `state/world` back to `world`.

*How to apply:* any new top-level (non-regional) archive that uses a bare slug
must be excluded from these bare-slug migrations the same way, or it will be
mis-namespaced on the next startup.

### 50. REST client surfaces a lost connection; it does not fabricate data in production

A genuine network failure (a thrown `fetch`) in the legacy REST client
[`web/src/lib/api.js`](../../web/src/lib/api.js) falls back to canned mock
data **only when `import.meta.env?.DEV` is truthy**. In a production build
Vite resolves that to `false`, so the mock branch is dead code (`getMockData`
and the whole mock dataset are tree-shaken out -- verified by grepping the
built bundle) and a thrown `fetch` instead `throw`s `ApiError(0, …)` and calls
`markDisconnected()`. Any response received -- even a 4xx/5xx -- calls
`markConnected()`, since it proves the server is reachable.

`api.js`, the live-map data store
[`web/src/lib/map/data-store.svelte.js`](../../web/src/lib/map/data-store.svelte.js),
and the basemap component
[`web/src/lib/map/maplibre-map.svelte`](../../web/src/lib/map/maplibre-map.svelte)
(its `fetchUpstreamStyle`, which uses a raw `fetch`, not `api.js`) all report
into the shared store
[`web/src/lib/stores/connection.js`](../../web/src/lib/stores/connection.js)
(`online`, `markConnected`, `markDisconnected`). The store is plain
`svelte/store` `writable`, **not** a `$state` runes module, because `api.js`
is imported by `node --test`, which has no Svelte compiler. Screens read
`online` to swap stale values for `--` placeholders and a lost-connection
indicator: the Dashboard clears `status`/`position`/`packets` and shows a red
banner; the APRS Logs screen shows a red "error" dot and no entries; the map
status bar shows the red "error" dot.

The map status bar (`LiveMapV2.svelte`) derives its dot/label from **both**
`$online` and `dataStore.pollingState` -- `!$online` forces "error" on its
own. This is load-bearing, not belt-and-suspenders: when the operator opens
the map while *already* offline, the basemap style fetch fails, so
`maplibre-map.svelte` never fires `oncreate`, `dataStore.start()` never runs,
and `pollingState` stays stuck at its initial `'idle'`. Seeding `pollingState`
from `get(online)` inside `start()` is therefore *insufficient* on its own
(it's dead code on that path); the status bar must read `$online` directly so
it shows "error" rather than a misleading green "idle" dot (GH #374). The
`start()` seed is still kept for the connected-then-disconnected first paint.

*Why:* before GH #365, a disconnected browser silently rendered the dev mock
channels (`VHF APRS`/`9600 Data`), mock position (`35.0N 106.0W`), and mock
beacons as if they were live, with a green status dot -- the operator had no
way to tell the connection was lost.

*How to apply:* use `import.meta.env?.DEV` (optional chaining) so the check
is safe under `node --test`, where `import.meta.env` is `undefined` -- there
it reads falsy, exercising the production throw path. `api.test.js` covers
this with a rejected-fetch case asserting `ApiError(0)` and `online === false`.
Only flip the connection store to offline on a genuine network failure -- in
the data store that means gating `markDisconnected()` on `e instanceof
TypeError`, since the manual HTTP-status `throw`s (incl. 401) come from a
reachable server and already ran `markConnected()`.

### 51. The stationcache reads `pkt.Comment`, so every parser must mirror its free-form text there

*Why:* `pkg/stationcache/extract.go` (`buildStationEntry`) takes the
displayed comment from `pkt.Comment` only -- it never reaches into the
per-type sub-structs. Most parsers (position, object, item) already
write their trailing text to `DecodedAPRSPacket.Comment` (or the
sub-struct's `Comment`, which `ExtractEntry` forwards). Mic-E is the
trap: `parseMicE` decodes the comment into `MicE.Status` and, before
GH #377, stopped there -- so mobile-beacon comments like
"KK4CUK Matt's Cozy" decoded correctly yet rendered blank in the UI
while aprs.fi showed them. The fix copies `mic.Status` into
`pkt.Comment` at the end of `parseMicE`. Any new packet type that
carries human-readable trailing text must populate `pkt.Comment` (or a
sub-struct `Comment` that `ExtractEntry` forwards); decoding it into a
private field alone makes it invisible downstream.

Mic-E corollary: the comment tail on real Byonics/McTracker mobile
beacons is `<text>|<base91 telemetry>|!<DAO>!|3`. `stripMicEPipeTelemetry`
removes each `|...|` block non-greedily (a greedy first-to-last sweep
ate the DAO and left a stray "3"), then drops a lone unterminated `|`
opener; `extractDAO` then consumes the `!DAO!`.

### 52. "RF Only" classifies on the current fix, not the whole trail

The Live Map "RF Only" filter shows a station only when its **current fix**
(`positions[0]`) arrived over the air (`direction === 'RX'`) and was not
Internet-to-RF gated (`gated`). The predicate `isRfOnly`
(`web/src/lib/map/rf-only-core.js`) inspects only `positions[0]` -- never the
accumulated trail.

*Why:* the data store accumulates a per-callsign trail by prepending each delta
fix (`data-store.svelte.js` `mergeStation`). A mobile station heard on RF
earlier and now arriving only via APRS-IS keeps a stale RF breadcrumb deep in
that trail. The old predicate scanned every position and qualified the station
on that stale breadcrumb, so it stayed visible under RF Only even though its
marker (drawn at `positions[0]`) and popup badge labeled it `APRS-IS` -- the bug
in graywolf GitHub #394. The marker is always `positions[0]`, so the filter must
classify off that same fix.

*Station-level fields are latest-packet metadata, with a short same-fix RF preference window.*
`updateMetadata` writes station-level reception metadata
(`Direction`/`Via`/`Gated`/`Hops`/`Path`/`Channel`) from the latest packet.
For a static same-position re-reception, `positions[0]` still keeps the
rfRank-best copy of that fix (direct RF > digipeated RF > gated/IS/TX), but
station-level fields only keep the prior RF-stronger value when the lower-rank
copy arrives within `sameFixRFPreferenceWindow` (currently 2 minutes).

Result: near-simultaneous duplicate receptions of the same beacon still read
as `RX` (the intended RF-over-IS tie-break), while a delayed IS-only period
eventually flips the station-level badge/table to `IS` as operators expect.
RF Only intentionally keys on `positions[0]` directly and is unaffected.

*How to apply:* keep RF Only keyed on `positions[0]` only. Static stations are
preserved -- `stationcache`'s static-rebeacon merge folds the most RF-reachable
copy of a fix into `positions[0]` via `rfRank` (invariant #48), so a fixed
station once heard on RF and later re-beaconed via a gated/IS copy still
qualifies. RF Only is the looser companion to Direct RX (#48): it keeps
RF-digipeated stations (`hops > 0`) and drops only APRS-IS and Internet-to-RF
gated current fixes.

*Badge-vs-`positions[0]` divergence is expected and explained.* Station-level
fields answer "what did we hear most recently?" (with the short same-fix RF
tie-break above), while `positions[0]` answers "what fix is plotted now?" and
retains rfRank-best metadata for that fix. `rfReachableDespiteNonRfLatest`
(`rf-only-core.js`) intentionally detects this divergence so the popup can
explain why a station may still qualify under RF Only when its latest packet
badge is non-RF.

### 53. Map-viewport membership is any-trail-position, not head-only

A station belongs to the current map view when **any** position in its
visible trail falls inside the bbox -- not only its newest fix
(`positions[0]`). Both ends of the live-map pipeline must agree on this:

- Server: `MemCache.QueryBBox` (`stationInBBox`) returns a station if the
  head or any non-trimmed trail point is inside the bbox.
- Client: the data store's `pruneOutOfBounds` keeps a station while any of
  its accumulated positions is inside the bbox, and drops it only once the
  whole track has scrolled off-screen.

*Why:* a head-only test on either side made a moving station's entire
still-visible trail vanish the moment its newest position left the viewport
(graywolf GH #413) -- the server stopped returning it and the client pruned
it. The two checks must stay symmetric: if the server is looser than the
client (or vice versa), tracks either flicker on bounds changes or pile up
as stale breadcrumbs.

*How to apply:* mirror the trail-cutoff trimming when scanning positions on
the server (head always counts; older points count only when newer than the
trail cutoff, matching `stationToDTO`) so membership reflects what actually
ships. Keep the client predicate any-position so it self-cleans: a track is
retained while partly visible and pruned once fully off-screen. The two
checks are symmetric in shape (any-position, inclusive bounds) but not
bit-exact: the client trail is length-capped (`MAX_TRAIL_LEN`), not
time-trimmed, so `trailIntersectsBBox` may scan slightly older breadcrumbs
than the server's cutoff-trimmed set. `pruneStale` still drops whole stations
by `last_heard`, so the looseness is bounded.

### 54. The stationcache trail is ordered newest-first by timestamp and deduplicates re-received fixes

`MemCache.Update` (`pkg/stationcache/memcache.go`) keeps each station's
`Positions` slice strictly **newest-first by `Timestamp`** and treats a
single physical beacon heard more than once as one trail point, not several.
Three paths enforce this for a position that differs from the head fix:

- *Static re-beacon* (`!positionMoved(positions[0], new)`): fold into
  `positions[0]`, advancing its timestamp/comment and rfRank-merging path
  metadata (invariant #48).
- *Late duplicate of an older fix* (`duplicateFix`): a digipeated, APRS-IS,
  or second-channel copy of an earlier beacon that lands within `posEpsilon`
  of an existing point **and** within `dupWindow` (2 min) of its timestamp.
  Merge the reception metadata into that existing point; do **not** insert a
  new point.
- *Genuinely new fix*: insert in timestamp order via `insertPositionByTime`
  (a plain prepend in the common in-order case), then cap at `MaxTrailLen`.

*Why:* the Live Map trail layer (`web/src/lib/map/layers/trails.js`) draws
one line segment between each consecutive pair of `positions`, so the array
order **is** the rendered path. The earlier code prepended every moved fix in
arrival order with no timestamp check and only deduplicated against
`positions[0]`. On APRS-IS and digipeated feeds, duplicate and out-of-order
copies are routine, so a delayed copy of an old fix was prepended as the new
head -- the track doubled back on itself, drawing spurious lines between
non-adjacent beacons (graywolf GitHub #421, reproduced "both with my own and
others tracks"). Ordering by timestamp and collapsing same-fix copies makes
the rendered line the chronological dot-to-dot path again.

*How to apply:* never assume packet arrival order equals chronological order.
Any new ingest path into the cache must go through `Update` so the ordering
and dedup hold. `dupWindow` is a deliberate spatial+temporal guard: it is
wide enough to absorb APRS-IS/store-and-forward delay but narrow enough that
a genuine return to a prior location well outside the window stays a distinct
fix. Delta mode (`since`) still emits only `positions[0]`, so an out-of-order
*historical* fix inserted mid-slice surfaces on the next full reload rather
than as a live delta -- acceptable, because the live head stays the true
newest fix and no backward line is emitted.

The dedup scan **cannot** be short-circuited for fixes whose timestamp is
newer than the head: a non-timestamped APRS packet is stamped with its
*reception* time (`extract.go`, falling back to `time.Now()`), so a delayed
copy of an earlier beacon -- the common real-world case -- carries the newest
timestamp of all and is identifiable only by location within `dupWindow`,
never by ordering. The scan is bounded, not full-trail: positions are
newest-first, so `duplicateFix` stops once it drops below the window's lower
edge. Note also that the history DB stores raw, un-deduplicated rows
(`historydb.WriteEntries`), ordered `timestamp DESC` on `LoadRecent`; a
hydrated trail therefore preserves correct ordering (no backward line) but
may show a redundant point that the live cache would have merged.

### 55. SmartBeaconing requires a `tracker` beacon, not just the global toggle

*Why:* The scheduler's `isSmart()` only adapts rate when a beacon's type is
`tracker` AND its per-beacon `smart_beacon` flag is set AND the global
`SmartBeaconConfig` singleton is enabled — all three. The global panel alone
does nothing without a tracker beacon, which is why a station with a working
GPS and SmartBeaconing "on" never beacons. The Beacons UI hides this: choosing
the `Tracker` type forces `use_gps`, sets `smart_beacon`, and auto-enables the
global singleton on save (mirroring the iGate auto-enable for APRS-IS-only
beacons). If you add a beacon type or touch the save path, preserve all three
gates or SmartBeaconing silently stops firing.

### 56. CLI subcommands must be the first argument, before any flags

*Why:* `cmd/graywolf/main.go` dispatches on `os.Args[1]` only — `auth`,
`flare`, and `version` are recognized solely in that position. Anything else
falls through to the daemon's flag parser (`pkg/app/flags.go`). So
`graywolf -config X auth set-password` does NOT run the auth subcommand: the
parser consumes `-config X` and reports the trailing `auth ...` as leftover
positional arguments. The working order is subcommand first, flags after:
`graywolf auth set-password --user admin -config X`. `flags.go` detects a known
subcommand landing in the leftover positionals and returns a hint pointing at
the correct order, using the `app.Subcommands` list (the single source of
truth). If you add a subcommand, add a `case` to the `main.go` dispatch switch
AND an entry to `app.Subcommands`. All operator docs must show the
subcommand-first order.

### 56b. Password length policy has one source of truth and is enforced only at creation

*Why:* `webauth.MinPasswordBytes` (8) and `webauth.MaxPasswordBytes` (72) are
the single source of truth for the password-length policy. Every
*creation* path routes through `webauth.HashPassword`, which rejects both
bounds, so the web setup form (`POST /api/auth/setup`), the `graywolf auth
set-password` CLI, and the server handler can never disagree — the bug in
graywolf#476 was setup accepting a sub-8 password the web login then
refused. Enforcement is at creation ONLY: `HandleLogin` and `CheckPassword`
do not length-check, so an account whose password predates the minimum
still authenticates (a login-side minimum locked such users out). The web
`Login.svelte` mirrors this — it validates min/max/confirm only in
`setupMode`, never on sign-in. If you change a bound, change the constant
and the operator docs (`docs/handbook/installation.html`), not a scattered
literal.

### 57. A station's own beacon reaches the map via the TX path, so every transmit leg must feed the station cache

*Why:* The Live Map plots stations from the `stationcache`, and the only
thing that puts the *local* station's own beacon into that cache is the
transmit side re-extracting the frame it just sent — there is no RX copy of
your own beacon (APRS-IS does not echo self-originated traffic back, and the
iGate's local-origin suppression would drop it if it did). A beacon has two
independent transmit legs, and **each leg owns its own cache feed**:

- *RF leg* → `pkg/app/wiring.go` governor TX hook (`source.Kind == "beacon"`)
  re-parses the frame as it hits the air and calls
  `stationcache.ExtractEntry(pkt, "beacon", "TX", channel)`.
- *APRS-IS leg* → `beacon.Options.OnISSent` (wired in the same spot) does the
  identical extract after a successful `isSink.SendLine`. The scheduler fires
  it from `sendBeaconWith` only on IS-send success.

The IS leg bypasses the governor entirely (`sendRF := b.SendPath !=
SendPathISOnly`), so it never reaches the RF TX hook. Before #438 only the RF
hook existed, so an `is_only` beacon — the natural config for a radioless or
RX-only iGate — was logged and reached aprs.fi but **never plotted on the
local map** (the "my position" GPS marker is a separate path and is *not* a
substitute). graywolf GitHub #438.

*How to apply:* if you add a third transmit destination, or split/rename the
send legs, wire a station-cache feed for it too — the map's view of your own
station is exactly the set of legs that re-extract. The `"both"` path
deliberately double-feeds (RF hook *and* OnISSent); that is harmless because
`MemCache.Update` collapses same-fix copies (invariant #54). Use `dir == "TX"`
for both legs so the fix keeps `rfRank` 0 (our own transmission, never
counted as RF-reachability evidence).

### 58. The heatmap counts one `rx_events` row per physical RF frame, at the ingest edge only

The direct-RX heatmap answers "where did RF energy actually reach our antenna
from," weighted by packet count, so it must count each off-air frame **exactly
once**. The counting lives at the sole RF-ingest edge — `dispatchRxFrame`
(`pkg/app/rxfanout.go`) calls `stationcache.BuildRxEvent(pkt)` and, on success,
`PersistentCache.RecordRxEvent`, which appends one `rx_events` row.

**Do NOT record from the station-cache write path.** `PersistentCache.Update` /
`historydb.WriteEntries` also run for the iGate RF->IS re-gate hook
(`wiring.go` `RfToIsHook`, which re-`Update`s the same RF packet with
`Direction "RX"`) and the startup roster reload (`wiring.go` seeds the cache
from `LoadRecent`). Counting there double-counts every gateable packet on an
iGate node and re-counts the whole roster on each restart.
`TestWriteEntriesDoesNotRecordRxEvents` guards this.

`BuildRxEvent` (`pkg/stationcache/heatmap.go`) is the single source of
attribution truth:

- **Gated** (third-party, `pkt.ThirdParty != nil`) or sourceless → no event.
- **Digipeated** (`aprs.CountHops > 0` with a last non-alias H-bit `"*"` digi):
  `attr_key = "stn:" + lastDigi`, `has_pos = false`. The origin's coordinates
  are deliberately **not** used — heat belongs at the digi we actually heard.
  `lastHBitDigi` skips generic aliases (WIDE/RELAY/…) to stay consistent with
  `aprs.CountHops`, so `SHEPRD*,WIDE1*` attributes to `SHEPRD`, not `WIDE1`.
- **Direct** (else): `attr_key = "stn:" + source`, carrying the packet's own
  coordinates when present (`has_pos = true`); positionless direct frames
  (messages/status) still count with `has_pos = false`.

At query time `QueryHeatmap` resolves every `has_pos = false` event from the
attributed station's latest stored position; still-unknown ones land in
`HeatmapResult.Unlocatable` rather than being dropped. Counting uses a dedicated
append-only table, not the `positions` table, because the latter dedups static
re-beacons (invariant #54) and would undercount high-volume fixed stations.
`QueryHeatmap` buckets located events at 4 decimal places (~11m). Retention is
`rxEventsRetention` (8 days), pruned in `Prune`.

### 59. An ax25conn session self-removes from the manager on terminal DISCONNECTED

`ax25conn.Manager` keys live sessions by the `(channel, local, peer)`
triple and rejects a second `Open` on the same triple with
`ErrSessionExists`. A session is removed from that table only when its
`Run` goroutine returns — the manager runs `go func(){ s.Run(ctx);
m.remove(key,id) }()`.

The invariant: **every transition into `StateDisconnected` from a live
state ends the session's life.** `setState` sets `s.terminated` whenever
`ns == StateDisconnected` (the initial DISCONNECTED never trips it —
`setState` short-circuits on an unchanged state), and `handle` returns
`false` when `terminated` is set, so `Run` exits, `cleanup` emits the
final DISCONNECTED, and `remove` frees the triple. This covers all
terminal paths: SABM/N2 timeout and DM-reject during setup, a peer DROP
while connected, and the DISC/UA release handshake.

*Why:* Before this, terminal transitions returned `true` and the session
parked in DISCONNECTED forever, leaking a goroutine + manager slot on
**every** disconnect. The operator-visible symptom (graywolf #456) was a
reconnect to the same peer failing with "ax25conn: session already
exists for this triple" until graywolf was restarted; the bridge's
`Close()` cancels only the bridge/pump context, not the session, so it
could not clear the stale entry on its own. Relatedly, a frame that
can't be handed to the TX backend now raises a one-shot `tx-failed`
error (guarded by `txFailNotified`) so a channel with no TNC/KISS/modem
backend surfaces the real reason instead of the misleading "no response
to SABM after N2 retries."

### 60. IS→RF third-party wrap emits exactly one `TCPIP` marker

The inner header `wrapThirdParty` builds for an IS→RF third-party packet
ends in a single canonical `,TCPIP,IGATECALL*` marker. Because the frame
arrived from APRS-IS, its inbound path may **already** carry a `TCPIP`
(or `TCPXX`) element ahead of the `qA*` construct, so the wrapper drops
any inbound `TCPIP`/`TCPXX` path elements (matched on `Address.Call`, so
an `*` H-bit marker doesn't defeat the match) before appending its own.
Legitimate elements like `WIDEn-N` are preserved.

*Why:* re-emitting the inbound `TCPIP` produced a duplicated
`...,TCPIP,TCPIP,IGATECALL*:` inner path (graywolf #488). Kenwood
handheld radios (e.g. TH-D75) reject that malformed path and silently
drop the message -- never displaying it or acking it -- breaking IS→RF
message delivery. Direwolf emits only a single `TCPIP`; matching that is
what makes the frame acceptable to strict parsers.

*How to apply:* the strip lives in the path loop of
[`wrapThirdParty`](../../pkg/igate/third_party.go). Never append a second
`TCPIP` and never trust the inbound path to be marker-free.

### 61. Directed-message addressee matching is SSID-aware, symmetric with the self-filter

The router only claims a directed (DM) message as its own when the
addressee is an **exact full-call match** of our station call, or a
**bare base-call address** (no SSID) sharing our base call. A distinct
SSID of our base call is a separate peer: running as `K0TFU-1` we do
**not** claim, file, or auto-ACK a message addressed to `K0TFU-7`. Both
`Router.classify` and the exported `MatchAddressee` helper (used by the
Actions classifier) route through `callAddressedToUs`, so the DM match
uses the same SSID granularity as the router self-filter (which already
compared full calls).

*Why:* the self-filter compared full calls but the addressee match
compared only base calls, an asymmetry that let one station steal a
sibling SSID's traffic. The sender then received a false delivery
confirmation -- a bot ACKed by `K0TFU-1` believed its message reached
`K0TFU-7` when it never did (graywolf #490). Two stations under one base
call with different SSIDs are distinct peers by design (same principle as
invariant on same-base delivery -- `NW5W-5` ↔ `NW5W-13`).

*How to apply:* never reintroduce a base-call-only DM addressee compare.
A bare base-call address stays generic on purpose -- every station
sharing the base call answers it. Route any new addressee-matching call
site through `callAddressedToUs` / `MatchAddressee`, never a hand-rolled
`baseCall(addr) == baseCall(our)`.

### 62. Inbound connected-mode frames decode with the owning session's negotiated modulus

The RX fanout hands every non-UI frame to `ax25conn.Manager.DispatchRaw`,
which resolves the owning session from the address header (modulus-
independent), reads that session's negotiated modulus race-free via
`Session.Mod128()`, and only then decodes the control field. The fanout
goroutine must **not** decode with a fixed modulus: a mod-128 (SABME)
link's I- and S-frames carry a **2-octet** control field, and decoding
them as mod-8 corrupts `N(S)`/`N(R)` so every inbound frame is dropped
and the link stalls.

Two sub-invariants make this work:

- **Control-field width is variable under mod-128.** U-frames
  (SABM/SABME/UA/DM/DISC/FRMR/UI/XID/TEST) stay **1 octet** under either
  modulus (v2.2 §4.2.2); only I/S frames grow to 2 octets. `Decode` sizes
  the control field by peeking the low two bits of the first control
  octet (`11` => U-frame => 1 octet). Assuming 2 octets for all mod-128
  frames rejects every U-frame — including the UA that completes the
  handshake — with "missing control field."
- **The modulus mirror is atomic.** The session goroutine negotiates the
  modulus at SABM/SABME time; `DispatchRaw` reads it from another
  goroutine. All writes go through `Session.setMod128`, which mirrors
  `cfg.Mod128` into an `atomic.Bool` that `Mod128()` reads, so the
  cross-goroutine read never races the negotiation write.

*Why:* the web AX.25 terminal exposes a "Negotiate modulo-128 (SABME)"
toggle, so mod-128 links are reachable in production. Before this, the
fanout decoded every connected-mode frame as mod-8, so an operator who
enabled extended mode received the BBS welcome but never any further
frames (graywolf #456).

### 63. `messages.Store.List` keyset order MUST match the cursor predicate's whole-second resolution

The chat UI pages through messages with a forward cursor
(`web/src/lib/messagesTransport.js` `fetchDelta`), so `(*Store).List`
does keyset pagination on `(updated_at, id)`. The cursor stores
`updated_at` at **whole-second** resolution (`strftime('%s', ...)`), so
the `ORDER BY` MUST truncate to the same resolution --
`CAST(strftime('%s', updated_at) AS INTEGER) ASC, id ASC`. Do NOT
"optimize" it back to `ORDER BY updated_at ASC` (full precision): that
mismatch makes the sort key finer than the cursor and silently strands
rows. Concretely, when an older/lower-id row's `updated_at` is bumped
into the same second as a newer, higher-id insert (routine ack
correlation / retry bookkeeping on a busy two-way thread), the older row
sorts after the cursor tip yet loses the `id` tiebreak and is never
returned again -- messages stop appearing in the chat window under
sustained volume (graywolf #521).

Full-precision text comparison is not an escape hatch: glebarez stores
time as trailing-zero-trimmed RFC3339Nano, whose lexicographic order is
not chronological (`".9Z"` sorts after `".90000001Z"`), and SQLite cannot
recover sub-second precision from the text via `strftime`/`julianday`
without loss. Whole-second resolution keeps the keyset key unique (id
breaks ties) and monotonic, which is all forward pagination needs.

*Why:* keyset pagination is correct only when the `ORDER BY` expression
is identical to the cursor predicate; any resolution gap between them
drops rows.

### 64. Web UI renders in Inconsolata everywhere; no system/Helvetica stack

Every visible glyph in the web UI is Inconsolata. The font is applied
through the `--font-mono` custom property (`'Inconsolata', 'Courier New',
monospace`), set on `body` by both `chonky-ui` and `web/src/app.css` and
inherited by headings and controls. Component CSS must not override
`font-family` with a system stack (`-apple-system`, `BlinkMacSystemFont`,
`system-ui`, `'Helvetica Neue'`, `Arial`, `sans-serif`); use
`var(--font-mono)`. The Messages surface (bubbles, invite text, compose
box) once carried an iOS-style stack "to feel like messaging" -- that was
removed so the product reads as one typeface (graywolf #576).

*Why:* a lone component reintroducing the platform font is exactly the
regression this issue fixed; it looks like a native iOS control dropped
into an otherwise-monospace app.

Two intentional exceptions, neither a UI text font:

- Emoji-only spans (e.g. the `.bolt` zap glyph) use an `'Apple Color
  Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Noto Color Emoji', system-ui, sans-serif`
  stack to render color emoji, not Latin text.
- MapLibre label layers name glyph sets (`'Open Sans ...'`, `'Arial
  Unicode MS ...'` in `web/src/lib/map/layers/fronts.js`) that must match
  the tile server's font stack; these are map-render font names, not CSS.

The per-tab page header (`web/src/components/PageHeader.svelte`,
`.page-title`) is pinned to `var(--font-mono)` at 22px.
