// Pure predicate behind the Live Map "RF Only" filter. A station qualifies
// when its current fix arrived over the air (RX) and did not reach us as
// Internet-to-RF gated traffic (the inner packet of an APRS third-party gate).
// Unlike "Direct RX" this keeps RF-digipeated stations (hops > 0); it only
// drops points whose latest reception was APRS-IS or Internet-to-RF gated.
//
// The check is against the current fix (positions[0]) only, never the whole
// trail: the marker is drawn at positions[0], so a station now arriving via
// APRS-IS must not stay visible under RF Only just because an older breadcrumb
// in its accumulated trail was once heard on RF (graywolf #394). For static
// stations the server folds the most RF-reachable copy of a fix into
// positions[0] (see stationcache rfRank), so a fixed station heard on RF and
// later re-beaconed via a gated/IS copy still qualifies. Note positions[0] can
// diverge from the popup's top-level direction/via badge in exactly that case:
// station-level fields follow the latest packet (except a brief same-fix
// RF-preference window), while positions[0] stays rfRank-protected. So
// positions[0] is the correct basis for RF reachability.

// rfReachableDespiteNonRfLatest reports the popup "RF-reachable" note case:
// the plotted fix (positions[0]) qualifies as RF-heard (isRfOnly) yet the
// station's *latest* packet -- the one that drives the popup badge / via line
// (station-level direction/gated, usually latest-packet) -- did NOT arrive
// over RF. That divergence is why a station badged "APRS-IS" can still,
// correctly, survive the RF Only filter: the marker is drawn at positions[0],
// which the server pins to the most RF-reachable copy of the fix via rfRank.
// The popup uses this to explain the visibility instead of reading as a bug
// (graywolf #482, the second report of this after #394).
